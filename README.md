-----< Rag App Agent >-----

This is a RAG Agent that I created.  It uses a PDF as an input.  In this case, "AI GUIDE" by the NATIONAL PROGRAM FOR ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENC.
My request to the Agent was, "What are the main categories of ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TODAY".  The reply is below.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) today is categorized into several key areas, each with unique characteristics and applications:

1. **General AI**: Also known as strong AI or Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), this category refers to machines that possess the capability to perform any intellectual, physical, and emotional task that a human being can. However, this remains a theoretical concept and has not yet been realized.

2. **Narrow AI**: This is the most prevalent form of AI currently in use. Narrow AI is designed to perform specific tasks such as speech recognition, image recognition, and language translation. These systems are highly specialized and excel in their designated functions.

3. **Super AI**: A theoretical form of AI where machines possess cognitive abilities that surpass human intelligence. Like General AI, Super AI is a concept that has not yet been developed.

4. **Machine Learning**: A subset of AI focused on the development of systems that can learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning is widely used in various applications today.

5. **Deep Learning**: Deep learning is a further specialization of machine learning, utilizing artificial neural networks to process and learn from vast amounts of data, mimicking the human brain's neural pathways.

6. **Neural Networks**: These are computer systems modeled to simulate the human brain and nervous system, forming the backbone of many AI applications.

7. **Autonomous Systems**: This category includes technologies like autonomous vehicles, drones, and robots, which are capable of performing tasks without human intervention.

8. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: NLP enables machines to understand and interpret human language, facilitating better human-computer interaction.

9. **Cognitive Cybersecurity**: AI systems designed to detect, prevent, and respond to cybersecurity threats, enhancing digital security measures.

10. **Robotic Personal Assistants**: These AI systems are designed to assist humans with personal tasks, ranging from virtual companions to personal assistant devices.
